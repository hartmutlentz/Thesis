\section{Perron-Frobenius Theorem for $\mathbf{P}_n$}
In the static case, the matrix $\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{1}$ is always primitive, i.e. if $\mathbf{A}$ is the adjacency matrix of a connected graph, than $(\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{1})^N$ is always full for one $N$.
(This does not necessarily hold for $\mathbf{A}^N$ alone).
What follows from this statement is, that $\mathbf{P}_n$ should yield a proper eigenvector centrality.
