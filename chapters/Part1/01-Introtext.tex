\chapter{Introduction to epidemics \& networks}
Livestock epidemics are a major economic issue.

\section{Epidemics}




\section{Complex networks}
A review on networks is found in \citet{Newman2003}.
Analyses of livestock trade networks are in \citet{Christley:2005}
\citet{Bigras:2007}\citet{Green:2006}.

The interplay between aggregation window and spreading potential was analyzed in \citet{Bajardi:2012}.

In principle, networks can be recognized in many systems including a matrix model, i.e. any kind of interaction between elements.
However, the focus of this work and of other works reported here lies in the topological complexity of the systems.
Therefore, the term \emph{complex network} is frequently used in the literature in order to make a distinction between systems with sophisticated topological features and systems showing a simple topology, such as lattices and trees.
