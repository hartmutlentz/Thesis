\paragraph{Models for epidemics\color{Cayenne}{.}}
The understanding and prediction of the spread of infectious diseases are important issues in modern societies.
In human medicine, an important goal is the control of severe diseases such as AIDS.
On the other hand, a reduction of economic loss by harmless diseases, such as common cold or flu, is important for political economy.
In the field of agriculture, livestock epidemics are a major economic issue.
A prominent example is food and mouth disease, which caused tremendous economic losses in the UK in 2001 \citep{Kitching:2005dd}.

In the context of understanding the principles behind epidemic spreading processes, i.e. the way how a disease is transmitted through a population, \emph{conceptional} models are used.
They make use of simple assumptions for the local (person-to-person) dynamics and focus on the big picture of the process.
Conceptual models are very similar to models in theoretical physics, because they focus on the very essence of the problem (here: the macroscopic view, spreading patterns).
However, they have to neglect many details of the real problem (here: physiology, symptoms, individual behavior, infection pathways and many more!) in order to have mathematically feasible models.
Another important issue of epidemiology is the \emph{forecast} of epidemic spreading processes.
Forecast models incorporate as much information as possible and the main focus is not an understanding of the basic principles.

%\subsection{Development of mathematical epidemiology}
Major contributions to the modern theoretical framework were provided by \citep{kermack:27}, \citep{bailey:57} and \citep{andersonmay:92}.
In his review about the mathematics of infectious diseases Hethcote reports a model for smallpox was already formulated in 1760 by D. Bernoulli (see \citep{Hethcote:2000} and references therein).
In the early 20th century, people developed mathematical models for epidemics: a discrete time model in 1906 \citep{Hamer} and a differential equation model in 1911 \citep{Ross}.
The epidemic threshold (section \ref{sec:sir_model}) was found in the 1920s \citep{kermack:27}.
Starting from Bailey's book \citep{bailey:57} in the 1950s, the modeling of infectious diseases became a major scientific research field.
Modern models of infectious diseases include vaccination, demographic structure, disease vectors, quarantine and even game theory (\citep{Bauch:2004} and references in \citep{Hethcote:2000}).
The availability of contact data in recent years led to a strong impact on network analysis on epidemiology.
Well known concepts of mathematics (graph theory \citep{Bollobas:1985}) and social sciences (social network analysis \citep{WassermanFaust}) have been adopted to disease modeling, since the connections between individuals are related to their epidemic spreading potential \citep{Keeling:2005}.

%\section{Complex networks}
Data of gigantic scale have emerged by the proliferation of computerized data acquisition and storage volumes in recent years.
A significant portion of this data describes interactions between elements in a system.
Depending on the particular system, both the interactions and the elements themselves can have various meanings.
Thus, for example the structure of the world wide web can be described by links between web pages, or a biological system by the food transport between individual species.
The availability of data describing such systems has facilitated the emergence of modern network science.
Network science is concerned in the broadest sense with the development, description and development of complex networks, no matter what the network structure describes in particular.
Due to its applicability to many different systems, network science is an inherently interdisciplinary field.
Interdisciplinarity is not least important, because subject-specific meta-information is needed for the validation of a specific result.

Network science makes use of tools and methods known from \emph{graph theory}.
The elements of a network are called nodes and the interactions are links between the nodes.   
The mathematical roots of graph theory originally go back to L. Euler \citep{euler:1736}.
In 1735, Euler solved the so-called Kšnigsberg bridge problem: the city of Kšnigsberg was divided by a river into four quarters, which were connected by 7 bridges.
Is it now possible to cross each of the bridges exactly once in a closed walk?
Euler reduced quarters to nodes and bridges to edges of a network such that the edges connect the nodes.
He was able to show that there is no closed path that uses each bridge exactly once.
He also has the given the conditions that must be met for the existence of such a closed path in any network.

Beyond the tools and methods of graph theory, the origin of modern network science goes back to psychology.
More specifically, the analysis of \emph{social networks} raised a lot of questions about the roles of particular individuals in these systems.
In fact, many of the measures of network theory have been defined in the psychological literature decades ago.



A review on networks is found in \citet{Newman2003}.
Analyses of livestock trade networks are in \citet{Christley:2005}
\citet{Bigras:2007}\citet{Green:2006}.

The interplay between aggregation window and spreading potential was analyzed in \citet{Bajardi:2012}.

In principle, networks can be recognized in many systems including a matrix model, i.e. any kind of interaction between elements.
However, the focus of this work and of other works reported here lies in the topological complexity of the systems.
Therefore, the term \emph{complex network} is frequently used in the literature in order to make a distinction between systems with sophisticated topological features and systems showing a simple topology, such as lattices.


Network science is capable of analyzing large scale systems.
Prominent examples are the internet or the world wide web.
Figure~\ref{fig:opte} shows a visualization of the internet on the physical level.
Note that the world wide web names the links between web pages, while the internet is the network of physical (or wireless) connections between routers.

This work has an explicit focus on \emph{paths} being a very essential property of networks.
