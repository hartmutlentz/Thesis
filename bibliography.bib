Summary
Modularity structure has a clear impact on sir dynamics in social networks. Targeted immunization is achieved by identifying nodes of high betweenness or similar measures. In contrast to non modular networks the correlation between degree and betweenness breaks down, so that high cb nodes that do not have a high degree can be identified. An even more sophisticated algorithm for detection of critical nodes is proposed.
