	Abstract = {Many networks of interest in the sciences, including social networks, computer networks, and metabolic and regulatory networks, are found to divide naturally into communities or modules. The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as ``modularity'' over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

@article{Haydon22012003,
	Abstract = {The case--reproduction ratio for the spread of an infectious disease is a critically important concept for understanding dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating impact of control measures on spread of infection. Reliable estimation of this ratio is a problem central to epidemiology and is most often accomplished by fitting dynamic models to data and estimating combinations of parameters that equate to the case--reproduction ratio. Here, we develop a novel parameter--free method that permits direct estimation of the history of transmission events recoverable from detailed observation of a particular epidemic. From these reconstructed `epidemic trees', case--reproduction ratios can be estimated directly. We develop a bootstrap algorithm that generates percentile intervals for these estimates that shows the procedure to be both precise and robust to possible uncertainties in the historical reconstruction. Identifying and `pruning' branches from these trees whose occurrence might have been prevented by implementation of more stringent control measures permits estimation of the possible efficacy of these alternative measures. Examination of the cladistic structure of these trees as a function of the distance of each case from its infection source reveals useful insights about the relationship between long-distance transmission events and epidemic size. We demonstrate the utility of these methods by applying them to data from the 2001 foot--and--mouth disease outbreak in the UK.},

Summary
Modularity structure has a clear impact on sir dynamics in social networks. Targeted immunization is achieved by identifying nodes of high betweenness or similar measures. In contrast to non modular networks the correlation between degree and betweenness breaks down, so that high cb nodes that do not have a high degree can be identified. An even more sophisticated algorithm for detection of critical nodes is proposed.},

	Abstract = {Networks grow and evolve by local events, such as the addition of new nodes and links, or rewiring of links from one node to another. We show that depending on the frequency of these processes two topologically different networks can emerge, the connectivity distribution following either a generalized power law or an exponential. We propose a continuum theory that predicts these two regimes as well as the scaling function and the exponents, in good agreement with numerical results. Finally, we use the obtained predictions to fit the connectivity distribution of the network describing the professional links between movie actors.},

@article{Amaral:2000,
	Abstract = {We study the statistical properties of a variety of diverse
 real-world networks. We present evidence of the occurrence of three
 classes of small-world networks: (a) scale-free
 networks, characterized by a vertex connectivity distribution that
 decays as a power law; (b) broad-scale networks,
 characterized by a connectivity distribution that has a power law
 regime followed by a sharp cutoff; and (c) single-scale
 networks, characterized by a connectivity distribution with a fast
 decaying tail. Moreover, we note for the classes of broad-scale and
 single-scale networks that there are constraints limiting the addition
 of new links. Our results suggest that the nature of such constraints
 may be the controlling factor for the emergence of different classes of
 networks.},

@article{Bajardi:2012,
	Abstract = {The spatial propagation of many livestock infectious diseases critically depends on the animal movements among premises; so the knowledge of movement data may help us to detect, manage and control an outbreak. The identification of robust spreading features of the system is however hampered by the temporal dimension characterizing population interactions through movements. Traditional centrality measures do not provide relevant information as results strongly fluctuate in time and outbreak properties heavily depend on geotemporal initial conditions. By focusing on the case study of cattle displacements in Italy, we aim at characterizing livestock epidemics in terms of robust features useful for planning and control, to deal with temporal fluctuations, sensitivity to initial conditions and missing information during an outbreak. Through spatial disease simulations, we detect spreading paths that are stable across different initial conditions, allowing the clustering of the seeds and reducing the epidemic variability. Paths also allow us to identify premises, called sentinels, having a large probability of being infected and providing critical information on the outbreak origin, as encoded in the clusters. This novel procedure provides a general framework that can be applied to specific diseases, for aiding risk assessment analysis and informing the design of optimal surveillance systems.},

@article{Green:2006,
	Abstract = {Livestock movements in Great Britain (GB) are well recorded and are a unique record of the network of connections among livestock-holding locations. These connections can be critical for disease spread, as in the 2001 epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK. Here, the movement data are used to construct an individual-farm-based model of the initial spread of FMD in GB and determine the susceptibility of the GB livestock industry to future outbreaks under the current legislative requirements. Transmission through movements is modelled, with additional local spread unrelated to the known movements. Simulations show that movements can result in a large nationwide epidemic, but only if cattle are heavily involved, or the epidemic occurs in late summer or early autumn. Inclusion of random local spread can considerably increase epidemic size, but has only a small impact on the spatial extent of the disease. There is a geographical bias in the epidemic size reached, with larger epidemics originating in Scotland and the north of England than elsewhere.},

@article{Christley:2005,
	Abstract = {Movement of animals represents considerable risk for the movement of infectious agents between farms and over considerable distances. Social network analysis provides tools to model and interpret contacts between farms associated with animal movements and other forms of contact. Using these methods we investigated the network of cattle movements throughout Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) in 2002. The structure of the movement networks was very heterogeneous, with most animal holdings having few on and off movements, but a few having very many. Investigation of a single four-week period identified the formation of giant weak and strong components, which were several orders of magnitude larger than the next largest components. The giant strong component for this period was a "small-world" network, and the degree distribution of this network followed a power-law distribution. The majority of movements occurred over the range of 10 to 100 km. Although some errors and omissions are known to exist in the movement records used in these analyses, the results of this study suggest clear features of the network of cattle movements in Great Britain that will have important implications for the transmission of infectious agents.},
