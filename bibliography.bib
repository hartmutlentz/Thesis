@article{Bajardi:2012,
	Abstract = {The spatial propagation of many livestock infectious diseases critically depends on the animal movements among premises; so the knowledge of movement data may help us to detect, manage and control an outbreak. The identification of robust spreading features of the system is however hampered by the temporal dimension characterizing population interactions through movements. Traditional centrality measures do not provide relevant information as results strongly fluctuate in time and outbreak properties heavily depend on geotemporal initial conditions. By focusing on the case study of cattle displacements in Italy, we aim at characterizing livestock epidemics in terms of robust features useful for planning and control, to deal with temporal fluctuations, sensitivity to initial conditions and missing information during an outbreak. Through spatial disease simulations, we detect spreading paths that are stable across different initial conditions, allowing the clustering of the seeds and reducing the epidemic variability. Paths also allow us to identify premises, called sentinels, having a large probability of being infected and providing critical information on the outbreak origin, as encoded in the clusters. This novel procedure provides a general framework that can be applied to specific diseases, for aiding risk assessment analysis and informing the design of optimal surveillance systems.},

@article{Green:2006,
	Abstract = {Livestock movements in Great Britain (GB) are well recorded and are a unique record of the network of connections among livestock-holding locations. These connections can be critical for disease spread, as in the 2001 epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK. Here, the movement data are used to construct an individual-farm-based model of the initial spread of FMD in GB and determine the susceptibility of the GB livestock industry to future outbreaks under the current legislative requirements. Transmission through movements is modelled, with additional local spread unrelated to the known movements. Simulations show that movements can result in a large nationwide epidemic, but only if cattle are heavily involved, or the epidemic occurs in late summer or early autumn. Inclusion of random local spread can considerably increase epidemic size, but has only a small impact on the spatial extent of the disease. There is a geographical bias in the epidemic size reached, with larger epidemics originating in Scotland and the north of England than elsewhere.},

@article{Christley:2005,
	Abstract = {Movement of animals represents considerable risk for the movement of infectious agents between farms and over considerable distances. Social network analysis provides tools to model and interpret contacts between farms associated with animal movements and other forms of contact. Using these methods we investigated the network of cattle movements throughout Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) in 2002. The structure of the movement networks was very heterogeneous, with most animal holdings having few on and off movements, but a few having very many. Investigation of a single four-week period identified the formation of giant weak and strong components, which were several orders of magnitude larger than the next largest components. The giant strong component for this period was a "small-world" network, and the degree distribution of this network followed a power-law distribution. The majority of movements occurred over the range of 10 to 100 km. Although some errors and omissions are known to exist in the movement records used in these analyses, the results of this study suggest clear features of the network of cattle movements in Great Britain that will have important implications for the transmission of infectious agents.},
